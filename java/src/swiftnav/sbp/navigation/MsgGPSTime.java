/** SBP class for message MSG_GPS_TIME (0x0100).
 *
 * You can have MSG_GPS_TIME inherent its fields directly from
 * an inherited SBP object, or construct it inline using a dict of its
 * fields.
 *
  * This message reports the GPS time, representing the time since
 * the GPS epoch began on midnight January 6, 1980 UTC. GPS time
 * counts the weeks and seconds of the week. The weeks begin at the
 * Saturday/Sunday transition. GPS week 0 began at the beginning of
 * the GPS time scale.
 * 
 * Within each week number, the GPS time of the week is between
 * between 0 and 604800 seconds (=60*60*24*7). Note that GPS time
 * does not accumulate leap seconds, and as of now, has a small
 * offset from UTC. In a message stream, this message precedes a
 * set of other navigation messages referenced to the same time
 * (but lacking the ns field) and indicates a more precise time of
 * these messages. */
